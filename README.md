# agy-auth

Standalone local session manager for Google Antigravity `agy` CLI/App.

`agy-auth` manages local AGY sessions. It can run the AGY sign-in flow, capture the resulting Antigravity credential from the OS keyring, store session snapshots back into the OS keyring, and restore one snapshot when you run `agy-auth switch`.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @badaruddinl/agy-auth
```

Then run:

```bash
agy-auth status
agy-auth login --alias main
agy-auth usage
agy-auth list --refresh
agy-auth list
agy-auth switch main
```

## How It Works

Antigravity stores the local CLI credential in the operating-system keyring. On the tested Windows install, the native entry is:

```text
service: gemini:antigravity
account: antigravity
```

`agy-auth login` runs `agy`, lets AGY complete sign-in, then reads the resulting active session credential and saves a copy under:

```text
service: agy-auth
account: <captured-email>
```

The registry at `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/accounts/registry.json` stores only metadata such as email, alias, and timestamps. The secret remains in the OS keyring.

## Commands

```bash
agy-auth status
agy-auth login --alias main   # run AGY sign-in, then save the session
agy-auth capture --alias main # save the currently active AGY session
agy-auth import --alias main  # same as capture
agy-auth list             # list stored auth snapshots
agy-auth list --refresh   # refresh active quota, then list
agy-auth usage            # read active quota from AGY /usage
agy-auth switch main      # switch by alias/email/key
agy-auth remove main
agy-auth native
agy-auth config
```

`agy-auth login` is the primary command for first login. It opens the normal `agy` flow. AGY shows its own sign-in state, for example `You are currently not signed in` followed by `Signing in...`. Exit AGY after sign-in; then `agy-auth` saves the resulting session snapshot.

Current tested AGY builds do not expose a native `login` or `--device-auth` subcommand in `agy --help`, so `agy-auth login` runs plain `agy` and captures the session after AGY exits.

`agy-auth list` shows reset times as actual local date/time values, for example `18:23` or `15:12 on 7 Jul`, instead of raw relative durations such as `118h 40m`.

## Multi-Account Flow

1. Run `agy-auth login --alias main` and complete AGY sign-in for account A.
2. Run `agy-auth login --alias backup` and complete AGY sign-in for account B.
3. Switch with `agy-auth switch main` or `agy-auth switch backup`.

After `agy-auth switch <alias|email|key>`, the active AGY credential in the OS keyring is replaced with the selected snapshot. AGY CLI/App loads the selected account from that active credential.

## Cross-Platform Notes

This package uses [`keytar`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keytar), which supports:

- Windows Credential Manager
- macOS Keychain
- Linux Secret Service / libsecret

AGY must use the same OS keyring service/account names for switching to work. If a future AGY release changes those names, override them with:

```bash
AGY_AUTH_TARGET_SERVICE="gemini:antigravity"
AGY_AUTH_TARGET_ACCOUNT="antigravity"
agy-auth status
```

On Linux, make sure Secret Service is available. On headless servers this usually requires a keyring daemon such as GNOME Keyring or KWallet.

## Scope

This tool is for local desktop or self-host workflows. It is not a public SaaS multi-user auth layer. For public multi-user systems, isolate each AGY runtime/profile or use a local agent per user/device.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm run lint
npm run pack:dry
```

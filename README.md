# agy-authx

Standalone local session manager for Google Antigravity `agy` CLI/App.

Install package `@badaruddinl/agy-authx`, then run the `agy-authx` command. The package also keeps the legacy `agy-auth` command available for compatibility. `agy-authx` saves multiple local AGY sessions in your operating-system keyring, lets you switch between them, and keeps a small registry at `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/accounts/registry.json`.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @badaruddinl/agy-authx
```

The package has no npm runtime dependencies and no native addon install step.

Installing `@badaruddinl/agy-authx` exposes both commands:

```bash
agy-authx --version
agy-auth --version
```

Use one runtime consistently:

- Windows AGY/App: run `agy-authx.cmd` from PowerShell or CMD.
- WSL/Linux AGY: install Node and `agy-authx` inside WSL/Linux.
- Do not install with Windows Node and execute the Windows shim as a Linux command from WSL.

## Commands

```bash
agy-authx status
agy-authx login --alias main
agy-authx login --activate --alias main
agy-authx login --cloud-project --alias work
agy-authx list
agy-authx list --refresh
agy-authx usage
agy-authx switch main
agy-authx verify
agy-authx remove main
```

`agy-authx login` saves the newly logged-in account but preserves the previously active AGY session when one exists. Use `agy-authx login --activate` when you want the newly logged-in account to become active immediately.

`agy-authx list` adapts to narrow terminals, keeps each account on one row, and highlights the selected active account when color output is available.

## How It Works

Antigravity stores the local CLI credential in the operating-system keyring. On the tested Windows install, the active AGY entry is:

```text
service: gemini:antigravity
account: antigravity
```

`agy-authx login` temporarily clears the active AGY credential, runs `agy`, lets AGY complete sign-in, reads the resulting active session credential, and stores a snapshot under the `agy-auth` service.

The registry stores metadata only: email, alias, timestamps, and cached usage. Secrets stay in the OS keyring.

## Multi-Account Flow

1. Run `agy-authx login --alias main` and complete AGY sign-in for account A.
2. Run `agy-authx login --alias backup` and complete AGY sign-in for account B. Account A stays active after this save.
3. Switch with `agy-authx switch main` or `agy-authx switch backup`.

If you want account B active immediately, run:

```bash
agy-authx login --activate --alias backup
```

For Antigravity App, the selected account is guaranteed at the shared credential layer. If the app was already open before switching, restart or reload the app session so it reads the newly selected credential.

## Keyring Requirements

This package stores credentials through the operating-system keyring without npm native addons:

- Windows: Credential Manager, accessed through PowerShell and the WinCred API.
- macOS: Keychain, accessed through the built-in `security` command.
- Linux: Secret Service / libsecret, accessed through `secret-tool`.

On Linux, `secret-tool` usually comes from the `libsecret-tools` package:

```bash
sudo apt install libsecret-tools
```

`secret-tool` is only the command-line client. A Secret Service provider must also be running, such as GNOME Keyring or KWallet. Desktop Linux sessions usually already have one. Headless servers often need extra setup for a keyring daemon.

On macOS, no extra package is normally required because `/usr/bin/security` is built in. macOS may still ask for Keychain access permission the first time credentials are read or written.

If a future AGY release changes the active credential names, override them with:

```bash
AGY_AUTH_TARGET_SERVICE="gemini:antigravity"
AGY_AUTH_TARGET_ACCOUNT="antigravity"
agy-authx status
```

## Npm README

The npm package intentionally uses a shorter install-focused README. The GitHub README stays more complete and includes development notes. During `npm pack`/`npm publish`, `scripts/pack-readme.js` temporarily swaps in `scripts/npm-readme.md` for the package tarball and restores this README afterward.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm run lint
npm run pack:dry
```

Before release, verify:

```bash
npm test
npm run lint
npm pack --dry-run
```
